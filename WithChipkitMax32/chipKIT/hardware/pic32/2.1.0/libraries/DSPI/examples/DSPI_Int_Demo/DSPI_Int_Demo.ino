/*
 * This is a very simple test of the DSPI library with interrupts, using the three available SPI ports
 * on a Fubarino SD chipKIT board. To run this test, simply connect the MOSI and MISO
 * pins of each of the three SPI ports to each other. This example code is based around the ability
 * of the DSPI library to use interrupts to peform the SPI transfers in the backgrounds. Because of
 * this, and because we want to show overlapping SPI transactions, we have to use six separate buffers,
 * three transmit and three receive. These buffers must be statically allocated (or through malloc())
 * so that the interrupts can have access to them during the entire transaction.
 * It then prints out all of the received bytes to the USB serial port. If everything is
 * working you should get the following printed to the serial monitor:
 * 11:22:33  44:55:66  77:88:99
 * See https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT-core/issues/349 for more information includeing
 * a logic analyzer trace of what this looks like as it runs.
 * 
 * The whole point of using interrupt based SPI transfers is so that you can do other things
 * with your code while the SPI transaction happens in the background.
