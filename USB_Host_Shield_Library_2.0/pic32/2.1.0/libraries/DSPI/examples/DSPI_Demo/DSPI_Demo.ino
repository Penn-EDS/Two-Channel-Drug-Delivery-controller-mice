/*
 * This is a very simple test of the DSPI library, using the three available SPI ports
 * on a Fubarino SD chipKIT board. To run this test, simply connect the MOSI and MISO
 * pins of each of the three SPI ports to each other. This test sends one set of 3
 * bytes out SPI0, back in SPI0, then out SPI1, back in SPI1, and out SPI2, back in SPI2.
 * It then prints out all of the received bytes to the USB serial port. If everything is
 * working you should get the following printed to the serial monitor:
 * 55:AA:A5  55:AA:A5  55:AA:A5
 * See https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT-core/issues/349 for more information includeing
 * a logic analyzer trace of what this looks like as it runs.
